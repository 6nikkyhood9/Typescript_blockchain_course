# Typescript_blockchain_course
A little typescript course. I made a small blockchain block, got familiar with typescript basics.

<h3>This repository for understanding basics.</h3>
<p>TypeScript is a programming language introduced by Microsoft in 2012 and positioned as a web application development tool that extends JavaScript. 
The developer of the TypeScript language is Anders Hejlsberg, who previously created Turbo Pascal, Delphi and C #. TypeScript is not just new JavaScript.
First, it should be noted that TypeScript is a strongly typed and compiled language, which is perhaps closer to the programmers of Java, C #, and other strongly typed languages. Although the compiler generates the same JavaScript at the output, which is then executed by the browser. However, strong typing reduces the number of potential errors that you might encounter when developing in JavaScript.
Second, TypeScript implements many of the concepts that are inherent in object-oriented languages, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation and access modifiers, and so on.
Third, the potential of TypeScript makes it faster and easier to write large, complex, complex programs, and thus easier to maintain, develop, scale, and test than in standard JavaScript.
Fourthly, TypeScript develops as an open source project and, like many projects, is hosted on github. In addition, it is cross-platform, which means that we can use both Windows and MasOS or Linux for development.
Blockchain is a continuous sequential chain of blocks (linked list), built according to certain rules, containing information.<p>
